<h1>Image Annotator</h1>

<h3>Guidelines for annotating relations between images and captions</h3>

<p>The goal of this annotation is not to annotate images or the text in
captions, the goal is to identify those image-caption pairs where the content of
the image line up with the content of the captions. That is, if the image is of
an event or object that is also mentioned in the caption, then that is what is
specified in the annotation.</p>


<p>The following labels are available:</p>

<table cellspacing=0 cellpadding=5 border=1 class=indented>

<tr valign=top>
    <td>EVENT</td>
    <td>The image shows an event or situation described in the text</td>
</tr>

<tr valign=top>
    <td>RESULT</td>
    <td>The image shows the result or aftermath of an event described in the text</td>
</tr>

<tr valign=top>
    <td>PERSON</td>
    <td>The image shows a person described in the text</td>
</tr>

<tr valign=top>
    <td>NON-PERSON</td>
    <td>The image shows a thing or animal described in the text</td>
</tr>

<tr valign=top>
    <td>LOCATION</td>
    <td>The image shows the location mentioned (includes maps)</td>
</tr>

<tr valign=top>
    <td>OTHER</td>
    <td>Unrelated,  or doesn't fit into these categories</td>
</tr>

<tr valign=top>
    <td>NOT-ENGLISH</td>
    <td>Text is not English. This does not apply to non-English text in the
    image.</td>
</tr>

</table>

<p>Select as many as apply, for example, an image that describes both a location
and a person mentioned in the text should be annotated with both the LOCATION
and PERSON labels. The one exception to this rule is that when you use the OTHER
or NOT-ENGLISH label then you should not add any other labels.</p>

<p>Some special cases:</p>

<ul class="spacy">

  <li>The image is of a map. Use the LOCATION label and nothing else, unless the
  map is an areal shot and clearly contains things .</li>
  
  <li>The image is a hybrid (several images, perhaps including a map,
  screenshots and who knows what). Imagine annotating the pairs of all sub
  images and the one caption (subimage1-caption, subimage2-caption etcetera) and
  enter the union of the results.</li>
  
  <li>There is a person mentioned in the caption by name and there is a person
  in the image that I do not know. Annotate as PERSON, unless you know that the
  person pictured is not the person mentioned.</li>
  
  <li>There is some doubt whether the event mentioned in the text is actually
  depicted in the image. Do not annotate this with the EVENT label.</li>

  <li>A location is mentioned in the caption, for example some town, but I do
  not know for sure whether the location shown in the image is actually that
  location. In this case use LOCATION if it seems plausable that the location in
  image and caption match, for example when the image shows a house and the
  caption says "countryside-residence in Mezhyhirya". Do not annotate with
  LOCATION if the location pictured clearly does not match what is in the
  caption or if you cannot determine what kind of location you see in the
  picture.</li>
